Bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

The bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers on September 15, 2008 was the climax of the subprime mortgage crisis.
After the financial services firm was notified of a pending credit downgrade due to its heavy position in subprime mortgages, the United States government summoned several banks to negotiate financing for its reorganization.
